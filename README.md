	phpunit-configuration.xml - the phpunit configuration file

## Accessing the documentation

Point your browser to `doc/index.html`.

## Installing the tester application

You will need a web server with a working PHP installation. If you are developing on Windows, [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) is an easy way to provide such an environment.

Next, open `build.properties` in your favorite text editor. Adjust the build settings so that `dir.deploy` points somewhere into your webservers document directory (ignore the phpunit setting for now):

	# point this to where you want to deploy the api tester
	dir.deploy=C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\maileon-api-tester
	
	# your phpunit executable
	phpunit=phpunit.bat

Now enter your Maileon API key inside the file `test/conf/config.include`.

For the next step, you will need a working installation of [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). Make sure to put the directory that contains the `ant` executable on your system's `PATH`.

Once ant is installed, run it inside the directory where you unpacked the API client:

	C:\projects\maileon-php-client-0.10.3>ant
	Buildfile: C:\projects\eagle_kunde\php-api-client\target\maileon-php-client-0.10.3\build.xml
	
	deploy:
	     [echo] [deploying project to C:\xampp\htdocs\maileon-api-tester]
	
	BUILD SUCCESSFUL
	Total time: 0 seconds

Now, you should be able to access the tester app using your browser. Given the example configuration above, just point your Browser to [http://localhost/maileon-api-tester/](http://localhost/maileon-api-tester/).

To verify that your installation works, check all the checkboxes in the "Ping - Tests" section and click the button "Run tests" on the bottom of the page. In order to perform the other tests, you will have to look at the source code and adjust the input data to match the data that is available inside your account.


## Installing the API client into your PHP application

Copy the entire `client` subdirectory to your webserver. Then, from the code that uses the client, include the client's main file:

	// Include the Maileon API Client classloader 
	require_once('./client/MaileonApiClient.php');
	
You can rename the `client` subdirectory, as long as you also change the path in the `require_once` directive accordingly. You may also want to install a root certificate bundle to enable secure transmissions over HTTPS. See the last section "Connecting to the API using HTTPS" of this document for instructions on how to achieve this.

## Running the PHPUnit tests

Download [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/) and put its executable on your `PATH`. If you're on a system other than Windows, adjust the name of the `phpunit` executable inside `build.properties`. Make sure that your Maileon API key is entered correctly inside the file `test/conf/config.include`.

Now run `ant test` inside the directory where you unzipped the distributable.

## Connecting to the API using HTTPS

Since it is likely that you will be transmitting sensible customer data over the API, you should use the SSL-enabled API endpoint `https://api.maileon.com/1.0` instead of the plain HTTP version. In order to do so, you will have to install a root certificate bundle for cURL by following these steps:

1. Download the bundle from http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem .
2. Copy the bundle to a directory that can be accessed by PHP.
3. Add the following entry to your php.ini (remember to change the path to where you put the cert bundle):

	curl.cainfo="C:\xampp\php\cacert.pem"

You should now be able to connect to the SSL-enabled API endpoint.
